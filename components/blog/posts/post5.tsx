    <h2>Introduction to Zero Trust Security</h2>
    <p>In today's digital landscape, traditional perimeter-based security models are no longer sufficient. With remote work, cloud adoption, and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, organizations need a security paradigm that assumes breach and verifies every access request. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) represents this fundamental shift in cybersecurity thinking.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Zero Trust: Never Trust, Always Verify</h2>
    <p>Zero Trust security is an IT security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter. Unlike traditional "castle-and-moat" security models, Zero Trust assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network.</p>

    <h3>The Evolution of Network Security</h3>
    <p>Traditional network security operated on the assumption that everything inside the corporate firewall was safe and could be trusted. Once an attacker breached the perimeter, they had free rein over the entire network. This vulnerability has been dramatically exposed by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increasing remote workforce and BYOD policies</li>
      <li>Cloud-based applications and infrastructure</li>
      <li>Distributed data across multiple locations</li>
      <li>Sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks</li>
      <li>Insider threats and compromised credentials</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Principles of Zero Trust Architecture</h2>
    <p>Zero Trust is built on several fundamental principles that work together to create a comprehensive security posture:</p>

    <h3>1. Verify Explicitly</h3>
    <p>Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User identity and behavior analytics</li>
      <li>Device health and compliance status</li>
      <li>Location and network context</li>
      <li>Real-time risk assessment</li>
      <li>Data classification and sensitivity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Use Least Privilege Access</h3>
    <p>Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA) principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grant users only the minimum access they need</li>
      <li>Implement time-limited permissions</li>
      <li>Use role-based access control (RBAC)</li>
      <li>Regularly review and revoke unnecessary privileges</li>
      <li>Separate duties to prevent unauthorized actions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Assume Breach</h3>
    <p>Minimize blast radius and segment access with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsegmentation to isolate workloads</li>
      <li>End-to-end encryption for all communications</li>
      <li>Continuous monitoring and threat detection</li>
      <li>Automated response to suspicious activities</li>
      <li>Comprehensive logging and analytics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Eight Pillars of Zero Trust</h2>
