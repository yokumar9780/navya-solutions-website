    <h2>Introduction to Data Governance</h2>
    <p>In today's data-driven economy, enterprise data has become one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. However, with great data comes great responsibility. Data governance is the discipline that ensures your organization's data is secure, private, accurate, available, and usable—while maintaining compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.</p>

    <h2>What is Data Governance?</h2>
    <p>Data governance is a comprehensive framework that defines who can take what action, upon what data, in what situations, using what methods. It encompasses the policies, standards, procedures, and organizational structures that ensure data is managed as a strategic enterprise asset.</p>

    <h3>Core Components of Data Governance</h3>
    <p>Effective data governance addresses several critical dimensions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data quality and integrity management</li>
      <li>Data security and privacy protection</li>
      <li>Regulatory compliance and audit readiness</li>
      <li>Data lifecycle management</li>
      <li>Metadata and master data management</li>
      <li>Data access controls and stewardship</li>
      <li>Data architecture and integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Data Governance Matters Now More Than Ever</h2>
    <p>The convergence of several trends has made data governance a strategic imperative:</p>

    <h3>Regulatory Complexity</h3>
    <p>Organizations face an increasingly complex web of data protection regulations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe</li>
      <li>CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the US</li>
      <li>HIPAA for healthcare data</li>
      <li>PCI DSS for payment card information</li>
      <li>SOX for financial reporting</li>
      <li>Industry-specific regulations (FINRA, GLBA, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-compliance can result in severe penalties—up to 4% of annual global revenue under GDPR, plus reputational damage and customer trust erosion.</p>

    <h3>Data Proliferation and Complexity</h3>
    <p>Modern enterprises face unprecedented data challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exponential growth in data volumes (big data, IoT, streaming)</li>
      <li>Diverse data sources and formats</li>
      <li>Distributed data across cloud and on-premises systems</li>
      <li>Shadow IT and unmanaged data stores</li>
      <li>Real-time and streaming data requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI and Advanced Analytics</h3>
    <p>Organizations leveraging AI and machine learning need robust governance to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure high-quality training data</li>
      <li>Prevent algorithmic bias and discrimination</li>
      <li>Maintain model transparency and explainability</li>
      <li>Protect sensitive information from exposure</li>
      <li>Meet responsible AI and ethical AI requirements</li>
